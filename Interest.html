            <h2>Interest In IT</h2>
            <p>
              Information Technology will be a new endeavour that I had not originally intended to commence. My passion previously belonged to the business side of the work industry and with great aspirations of one day completing a commerce degree even completing economics and business in year 12 much has changed since this forethought. After many months of research and soul searching, I came to the conclusion that becoming a marketing manager or a business development manager may not be what I may want for my future. Many credible resources such as the government’s website “job outlook” indicated potential job growth minuscule in comparison to that of the technology world. With higher employment, greater employee benefits, substantial pay and high rates of job satisfaction technology immediately became the conspicuous answer. It became evidently clear that my passion had always been in the tech realm making this decision even greater. Being in a family where many of my cousins are lawyers, pharmacists and accountants great expectations were expected of me and being the eldest in my household also the first to undergo a University degree large shoes had to be filled. However, having little experience with IT or programming a slight feeling of hesitance did reach me. Nevertheless, with dreams of one day becoming a software engineer Information Technology is the first step in which I must transgress in order to make this a reality.

              There are many reasons why RMIT became my University of choice. After completing thorough research RMIT is one of Australia’s leading universities in the Information Technology field. With exceptional facilities, teachers and professors to accommodate for student learning RMIT offers all and more to ensure its students achieve the greatest level of success that they can. Living in the western suburbs RMIT is a short 40-minute train ride for me in comparison to an hour and a half train ride to Monash and being in the heart of Melbourne situated in the City RMIT offers great convenience in terms of transport to its schools for students. Furthermore, student social life is an ease with many great restaurants surrounding its city campus and with many clubs to join such as RAA making friends is not so challenging. Knowing many students who have moved from Swinburne University or Latrobe to RMIT many of these students have expressed their approval and gratification of how great RMIT is, convincing and assuring me further of RMIT’s greatness making the University my clear choice.

              At RMIT while studying Information technology I expect to learn much not only about Information Technology but industry work where IT is crucial in its development. I hope to ideally expand my knowledge of multiple programming languages such as Java or Python and even eventually master them. However, I do not expect to obtain this level of skill in my short span of 3 to 4 years at RMIT. I hope to understand what it means to utilise IT in the real world and how real-world concepts such as UX and UI designs are continually used every day. Nevertheless, learning IT is not the only path in which I want to continue I wish to learn about the culture of RMIT or continue my old passion of economics as an elective and maybe become fluent in a third language. However, IT remains at the epicentre of my goals and ambitions as I am greatly motivated in the pursuit of my dreams.
