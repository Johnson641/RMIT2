            <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
            <p>
              In the not so distant future, I have aspirations of pursuing a job as a Business Analyst assuming I continue my IT degree or software engineering once I have completed my computer science degree. As this is an IT course I will continue on the appeal of a Business Analyst or a Business Systems Analyst role. With a median salary of $110k, the role of a business analyst combines both the worlds of IT and business together. The role of a business analyst is to review how a business operates creating greater efficiencies for the future of the business while also leading project teams and relaying their knowledge and technical understanding back to the business. This role first caught my eyes as it combined both IT and business creating a working environment that does not require me to be consistently staring at a screen for 8 hours a day and mixes both of my passions into one. My ideal job consists of communicating with people daily, leading my own team while also immersing myself in technology which delineates the role of a business analyst. The salary is enough to live more than comfortably and the job growth is expected to grow 29.6% in the next 5 years according to seek.com and predicted to be “very strong” on job outlook within the same period. With a rating of 4 out of 5 stars in terms of job satisfaction according to seek.com, many business analysts are content with their jobs. However, the salary of a greater experienced business analyst may reach north of $130k a year.

              To become qualified as a business analyst one must complete a bachelor degree in business, IT, business analytics or a related field. Many begin their careers in a junior business analytics role or another role within the IT realm to gain experience before officially becoming a senior business analyst. Some may also consider joining the Australian chapter of the International Institute of Business Analysis (IIBA). This allows one to gain skills by obtaining industry-recognised certificates. One should also become accustomed to the International Institute of Business Analysis BABOK Guide. As this is the guide which is globally recognised by companies all over the world containing concepts and material most if not all business analysts should know. University my clear choice.

              While being fresh to IT I have yet to obtain industry-recognised skills for most job qualifications, I am open to learning and motivated in its pursuit. Currently working as a casual in warehousing and logistics I have had a glimpse of the logistics area of the industry providing me with knowledge many have yet to learn while providing me with leadership skills by leading my own small team within the warehouse in order to work efficiently and effectively. I know the basics of python but not yet enough to be fluent in the coding language.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eventually, once I graduate I would have obtained enough knowledge and skills to effectively use my abilities to aid the business I wish to work for. Ideally, RMIT will have provided me with much of the primary knowledge such as programming, leadership skills and other real life IT concepts that are greatly utilised. After graduation, I hope to obtain an entry-level position where I will obtain experience in the industry while conducting my own research to further enhance this and implement my outside research for the business I work with. I also wish to integrate myself within group projects as much as possible while taking honest and respectable advice from my peers in ways that I continually improve on my work, as I believe no one person can perfect a skill. I will also read the International Institute of Business Analysis BABOK Guide to get further ahead of my peers and gain success in an efficient but not in a hastily manner.
