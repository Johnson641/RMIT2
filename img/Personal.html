             These test results which may not be vindictive of a person’s character may offer businesses and companies to be provided with a slightly clearer insight into what type of person you are. However, a business should not be heavily reliant on these types of tests as it is heavily built on a trust system and does not illustrate clearly what kind of person one may be. Although, these tests are useful in some perspectives as they may allow a business to choose certain types of people for a particular job. For example, people with natural leadership skills may be more heavily considered to be placed in a leadership role as they offer great natural traits for the role. Furthermore, a person with a more creative personality may be a greater leader than the person with natural leadership traits. These tests may be beneficial to look at but will become counterintuitive if heavily relied on.

            With a “protagonist” trait and a strategy in people mastery, I hope to lead my team in the right direction while offering related, respectful and useful advice to my team members. I want to ensure everyone in my group understands what is required of them and when it should be done. However, I hope my group members do the same for me by reminding me of deadlines that are arriving or tasks I must do myself. Furthermore, with an auditory learning style, I will present different learning techniques to my team members who share the same learning style as myself or those who may find my learning techniques easier to utilise. Nevertheless, with the protagonist personality, I hope to be of use to my team by managing our tasks and allocating them effectively.

            While forming a team it may be wise to not form a full team with the protagonist personality as although being great leaders protagonists hold strong views on how tasks should be carried out. With a team largely consisting of protagonist trait personalities many ideas will clash which may impede the workflow. It may also be difficult if 2 or more people lead as everyone has a different leading style and ways they wish to approach a certain task. It may be a greater idea for me if I form a group with other members with different personality types as they may provide their insights and ideas without crossing roads with my
