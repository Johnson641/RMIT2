            <h2>Project Idea</h2>
            <p>
              A personnel project idea I have conjured up is a concept that consists of an app that enables, users, to find and obtain the cheapest prices for certain goods and services. For example, if a person is looking for a particular brand of chocolate i.e Cadbury they may enter the product into the search engine which will locate the cheapest prices for that particular product in a certain area. You may filter out the size of the search radius or order these products to your home at participating stores. Another example is that, In light of the petrol prices crisis, the app may also find the cheapest prices for petrol in a given radius. The app may also indicate other products or services that aren’t tangible in themselves such as haircuts. Like many other apps, reviews for each service or retailer may be posted on the app itself by verified or non-verified accounts. A user of the app may select a store in which they intend to visit and get a code scanned on their mobile app. With enough usage, they may be eligible to further discounts to certain stores encouraging participants in continuing using the app.
            </p>
            <p>
              The inspiration for this idea comes with the web browser extension called Honey. Honey applies discount codes automatically while online shopping as it searches the web for the best discount codes for the particular website. In its honour, I intend to call my app Molasses as many bakers refer to molasses as being liquid gold due to its distinct colour and versatility in baking. Like Molasses the app will be versatile and easy to use. I have found a need for this app and gained inspiration as anyone would like to save money. Therefore, pondered why there is not a single app dedicated to doing so? As mentioned before with rising prices in petrol prices reaching as high as $2.30/L I have continually wondered where the cheapest place to refuel my vehicle was. However, why stop at fuel? Why not branch out to grocery products, services, entertainment and so much more? I believe anyone who utilises the app may benefit from its usage.
            </p>
            <p>
              The app specifically will entail many features. It can indicate to users where the cheapest prices are for particular goods and services while remaining easy and simple to use. The app is recommended to all ages and anyone using the app may benefit. The user may also enter into the filter how far of a search radius they would like the app to search. Through the app, users may also find directions or the store's trading hours. Users may also order goods such as groceries straight to their doors with participating retailers. This may also benefit smaller businesses that do not have an official website or a delivery service to obtain one. People who use the app may also make appointments straight through the app depending on the service such as a haircut or even hiring a plumber. Stores or businesses may post their business on the app in return giving back to us the app owners a percentage of the sale they made through the user. This percentage may vary depending on the industry and circumstances, however, will remain as fair as possible. As mentioned before a user of the app may scan a QR code or enter a numerical code on the app every time they make a purchase or receive service in order to obtain points. This may allow them to receive discounts on goods and services such as 5 cents off of every 2 litres of petrol, or 10 dollars off their next grocery purchase. Like many other apps, the app may have tiers of rewards, providing those who use the app more to receive greater rewards, for example, bronze, silver and gold tiers. The goal of the app is to allow people to save as much as possible. Nevertheless, the app’s main goal will be always to search for more and more cheap locations for particular products.
            </p>

              This app would only require a simple app creation tool in terms of the design for the app. The bulk of the software will be invested into the search engine and for the app to be continually updated to ensure the best prices consistently every day and to possibly automatically recommend goods and services to users. This may require either a couple hundred or thousands of lines of code. The recommended programming language for app development is swift which may be the primary programming language to produce this app. However, we will be programming with swift on Xcode as it allows us to design the UI and code of the app and once completed publish the app onto the app store as well. Swift, however, can only be downloaded on mac computers which may cause some issues for some, although with my group in mind we all own a mac computer in some form e.g iMac, MacBook Pro and etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                In terms of skills required this app would require intricate and possibly advanced coding competence to develop the app’s software. The app as of now may be relatively difficult to code for due to the fact that I like many of my peers currently lack the knowledge or the know-how to code such an intricate piece of software. Although tools online or even youtube may provide us with some piece of information on how to program on swift. Nevertheless, like mentioned before one of our main issues may occur while downloading swift as it is a mac computer software only, although all group members involved own a mac.
              </p>
              <p>
                In an ideal world, this will hopefully save hundreds if not thousands of people money. With prices on groceries and fuel rising due to the shortage and high demand, many need more ways in which to save money. We hope Molasses like many other successful companies become a household name and is easy to use to ensure that even the older generation may operate the app. We want to ensure that anyone can use the app and may seek some benefit through the usage of the app and recommend it to friends and family alike. As this may change how many may shop and may start a new revolution for other apps.
